# THiNX: Kato Fong

This is automated chat-bot for [THiNX OpenSource IoT management platform](https://thinx.cloud). It should serve to administrator.

### Server Administrator

When new THiNX instance is installed, chatbot instructs the first root/administrator user.

Installation will be divided into several steps and when root user logs in for the first time, Kato Fong takes over and drives the user through Platform Builder installation, etc.

### Server User

Like on other sites, we would like to provide semi-AI real-time chat that is now possible with websockets.
